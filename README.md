# Minimal reproduction of `monaco-yaml` not working with vite.

This is copy of https://github.com/remcohaszing/monaco-yaml/tree/main/examples/vite-example \

But using actual `"monaco-yaml": "^5.4.0"` package from npm instead of linking via `"monaco-yaml": "file:../.."`

To reproduce install dependencies and run `pnpm start`
